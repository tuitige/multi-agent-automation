### Title: CI: Generate package-lock.json for Docker builds

**Body:**
The current CI/CD workflow fails at the Docker build step for services/agent-langgraph and services/mcp-server because npm ci requires a package-lock.json file. To fix this, add steps to the CI workflow that run npm install in each service directory before the Docker build step, ensuring package-lock.json is generated and present.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Add npm install step to services/agent-langgraph and services/mcp-server in the workflow before Docker build.
- Confirm package-lock.json is present and committed if needed.
- Docker build passes with npm ci --only=production for both services.
